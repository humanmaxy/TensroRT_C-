# TensroRT_C-
TensorRT C++ 
The code implements a C++ program that uses tensorrt to accelerate any existing modelã€‚

You need to install tensorrt, cuda and opencv. When using an nvidia 4060 graphics card, the original cpu 500ms algorithm is improved to cuda 160ms.My the tensor algorithm can be completed in 50ms. The inference time is only 10ms, and the data and model loading takes more time.
